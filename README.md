# Accessing Web Data using Python

#### This is a repository containing the files for the course.

#### Each week has its own folder containing the files of that week.

##### I have renamed the weeks using W-1, since Week 1 contained no technical knowledge per se. It is thus, Week 0 here.

-> Week 1 dealt with regular expressions (regex). The assignment and the supporting files are uploaded.

-> Week 2 dealt with sockets and HTTP connections using Python. The assignment consisted of making a successful http connection with a website and receiving the response. This was done using the sockets library.

-> Week 3 dealt first dealt with a library built atop the sockets library to provide more abstraction called urllib. We combined this with BeautifulSoup and performed elementary web scraping. The final assignment was a challenging one bs4_assignment2.py

-> In Week 4 I worked with XML. I understood the need for serialization and combined the knowledge gained in the previous weeks with this week's to build a web scraper and perform operations on XML documents. We used the xml library and the xml.etree.ElementTree function to construct a XML tree and performed opeerations.
